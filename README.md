# UFOs

## Overview
In this module, we begin our JavaScript journey by looking into its technical aspects and how it applies to the field of data analytics and visualization. We create a table to organize UFO data that is stored as a JavaScript array, or list. This table will have the ability to filter data based on certain criteria and will be created using JavaScript as the primary coding language.

## Results

Our webpage has been modified to have a filter for several search criterias. We created a row to filter our search results by "Date", "City", "State" "Country", "Shape" which provides us with some flexibility to narrow down specifics of our UFO search.

## Summary
In conclusion we've been able to use the data presented to us from a JS file to create an interactive and visually appealing webpage using HTML and CSS to style the presentation and design of our page. Dana and her manager should be content with the webpage provided for our UFO search.
